Hi there!

I'm an Environmental Engineer specializing in numerical modeling for water resources management and I love sharing my knowledge on applied hydrological modelling (from groundwater to rainfall-runoff). 

A few years ago I started scripting in R to pre-and postprocess data for modelling and have been contributing to several teaching projects (have a look at the pinned repositories).
